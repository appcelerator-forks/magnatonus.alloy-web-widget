# AlloyWebWidget

## Summary

This is a test Titanium project created  using the Ricardo Alcocer project TiAlloyCharts 

https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/TiAlloyCharts

to test/show that using more than 1 widget in a window/view does not work. This is an example of my Titanium Q&A question here

http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/180719/webview-widget-asset-javascript-reference

and similar to this one here 

http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/180747/multiple-graphs-in-single-window

This does not seem to be project specific but rather specific to using a webview and associated javascript in a widget.
